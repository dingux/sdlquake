See both source/pc & source/portable.
source/pc source files work on PC but they don't save properly.
Using the files from source/portable will make it crash when trying to start a ga√πme.

Using the files from source/pc will break saves on both platforms (RS97 & PC).
However, using the files from source/portable will make the saves work on the RS-97, except that starting a game
with those crashes the game on PC.
WHY ? I've wasted so much time with this bullshit.
